# DB_SG_Backup
if you already have another offline cache installed you can back that up using the DB_SG_Backup payload and place the ApplicationCache.db from that backup on the root of a usb drive and use this payload to reinstall it if you have to delete the browser data or lose it for any reason.
Works on all FW from 5.05 to 7.5X
